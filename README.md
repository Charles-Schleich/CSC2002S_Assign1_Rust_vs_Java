# CS2002S 2020 Assignment 1

Tutoring a student studying at the University Of Capetown
Problem statement is inside `CSC2002S PCP1 Assignment.doc`
Assignment concerns Java Fork-Join framework 


I was curious to see how Rust performed against java.
I still need to multi-thread the rust version. 


Non --release rust is slow, --release rust is fast. 
`Vec<f64>` is slower than `&[f64]` (unsurprisingly)


Cool little (unfinished) experiment
